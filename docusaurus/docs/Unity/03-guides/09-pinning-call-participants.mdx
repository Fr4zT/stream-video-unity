description: How to pin participants
---

The StreamVideo SDK has support for pinning users, both locally for the current user, and remotely for everyone in the call.
Every user can pin as many participants on the call as they want, and those users will be shown first in the list of participants for that user. Pinning someone for everyone in the call requires the `pinForEveryone` capability.
By default, the pinned users appear first in the `streamCall.SortedParticipants` array. The ones which are pinned remotely appear before the local ones. If there are several remotely pinned users, they are sorted by the pinning date (the most recent pins appear first).

### Local pins
In order to pin a user locally:

```csharp
streamCall.PinLocally(participant);
```

To unpin the user:
```csharp
streamCall.UnpinLocally(participant);
```

In both examples, the `participant` is an object of type `IStreamVideoCallParticipant`.

To get all pinned participants:
```csharp
foreach (var pinnedParticipant in streamCall.PinnedParticipants)
{
    // Iterate through pinned participants
}
```

You can check if the participant is pinned either locally or remotely by:
```csharp
var isPinned = streamCall.IsPinnedLocally(participant);
```

Or to distinguish whether the participant is pinned locally or remotely you can more specific versions:
```csharp
var isPinnedLocally = streamCall.IsPinnedLocally(participant);
var isPinnedRemotely = streamCall.IsPinnedRemotely(participant);
```
