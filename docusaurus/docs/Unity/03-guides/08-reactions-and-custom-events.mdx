description: How reactions and custom events work
---

You can send reactions to your call very easily with the code below:

```csharp
await streamCall.SendReactionAsync("like");
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction or specify a specific emoji.

```csharp
await streamCall.SendReactionAsync(type: "like", emojiCode: ":like:",
    customData: new Dictionary<string, object>()
    {
        // Put any parameters you want
        { "position", new Vector2(100, 200) }
    });
```

Custom data is of type `Dictionary<string, object>` meaning that you can pass any amount of parameters of your type. As long as it can be serialized to JSON string.

### Custom Events

You can also send custom events to which you can implement your own handlers.

```csharp
await streamCall.SendCustomEventAsync(new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    // Put any parameters you want
    { "type", "epic_event" },
    { "some_number", 50 },
    { "tags", new string[] { "ninja", "cat" } }
});
```
