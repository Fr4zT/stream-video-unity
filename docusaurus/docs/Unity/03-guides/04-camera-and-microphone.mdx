This page shortly describes how to send **Audio** and **Video** data to other participants.

Before you can set audio and video input sources you need to set up an instance of `StreamVideoClient`. Follow the [Client & Auth](../03-guides/01-client-auth.mdx) guide to learn how to do it.

## Setup sending Audio

In order to send audio data you need to set an instance of [AudioSource](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html) as an **input source** by calling the `SetAudioInputSource` method on the instance of `StreamVideoClient`.

```csharp
_client.SetAudioInputSource(audioSource); // audioSource is of type AudioSource
```

### Handle microphone input in Unity

The way you start streaming audio from a microphone device is by calling Unity's `Microphone.Start` method and providing the microphone device name.
You obtain the microphone device name from Unity's `Microphone.devices` array.

```csharp
// Obtain reference to an AudioSource that will be used a source of audio
var inputAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();

// Get a valid microphone device name.
// You usually want to populate a dropdown list with Microphone.devices so that the user can pick which device should be used
_activeMicrophoneDeviceName = Microphone.devices.First();

inputAudioSource.clip
    = Microphone.Start(_activeMicrophoneDeviceName, true, 3, AudioSettings.outputSampleRate);
inputAudioSource.loop = true;
inputAudioSource.Play();

_client.SetAudioInputSource(inputAudioSource);
```

#### Change microphone device during the call

Here's an example of how to change the active microphone device:

```csharp
// Stop previously active microphone
Microphone.End(_activeMicrophoneDeviceName);

// Obtain reference to an AudioSource that was setup as an input source
var inputAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();

inputAudioSource.clip = Microphone.Start(newMicrophoneDeviceName, true, 3, AudioSettings.outputSampleRate);
```

In case you need to use a different reference to `AudioSource`, you can simply call the `_client.SetAudioInputSource` again, and the audio track will be updated with the new audio input:
```csharp
_client.SetAudioInputSource(inputAudioSource);
```

#### Additional Notes

- For standalone platforms like **Windows** or **macOS** you'd usually implement a dropdown menu populated with `Microphone.devices` so that the user can pick which microphone device should be used. The reason for this is that on standalone platforms there can be multiple microphone devices plugged in.
- For mobile platforms like **Android** or **iOS** microphone devices are handled by the OS, so you usually just pick the first device.
- You should handle the case where user does not have a microphone device at all and the `Microphone.devices` array is empty.
- For mobile platforms like **Android** or **iOS** it's best to request a permission to access the microphone and handle the case where user did not grant the permission to use it. Read more in [Unity's docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.RequestUserAuthorization.html)

Please refer to Unity's documentation for more information on how to use **Microphone** devices:
* [Microphone.devices](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Microphone-devices.html)
* [Microphone.Start](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Microphone.Start.html)
* [Microphone.End](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Microphone.End.html)

## Setup sending Video

In order to send video data you need to set an instance of [WebCamTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.html) as a **video source** by calling the `SetCameraInputSource` method on the instance of `StreamVideoClient`.

```csharp
_client.SetCameraInputSource(activeCamera); // activeCamera is of type WebCamTexture
```

### Handle camera device input in Unity

They way you start streaming video from a camera device is by creating a `WebCamTexture` instance using the camera device name (obtained from `WebCamTexture.devices`) and calling `Play()` on the `WebCamTexture` instance.

```csharp
// Obtain a camera device
var cameraDevice = WebCamTexture.devices.First();

// Use device name to create a new WebCamTexture instance
var activeCamera = new WebCamTexture(cameraDevice.name, 1920, 1080, 24);

// Call Play() in order to start capturing the video
activeCamera.Play();

// Set WebCamTexture in Stream's Client - this WebCamTexture will be the video source in video calls
_client.SetCameraInputSource(activeCamera);
```

The video resolution and FPS parameters you set in your `WebCamTexture` instance will be used for the video publishing settings. In the above example, the video will aim to be streamed at 1080p (1920x1080) resolution and 24 frames per second.

:::note

Stream service will dynamically adjust the video resolution and FPS parameters based on the network traffic. The ultimate goal is to ensure a smooth video experience without video stuttering. The settings you provide are the maximum aimed for if the network conditions allow it.

#### Change camera device during the call

The most efficient way to change the camera device is to update the `deviceName` property on the instance of `WebCamTexture` that was previously set as an input source via `_client.SetCameraInputSource`:

```csharp
_activeCamera.Stop();
_activeCamera.deviceName = newDeviceName;
_activeCamera.Play();
```

In case you need to use a different reference to `WebCamTexture`, you can simply call the `_client.SetCameraInputSource` again, and the video track will be updated with the new camera input:
```csharp
_client.SetCameraInputSource(activeCamera);
```

#### Additional Notes

- For standalone platforms like **Windows** or **macOS** you'd usually implement a dropdown menu populated with `WebCamTexture.devices` so that the user can pick which camera device should be used.
- For mobile platforms like **Android** or **iOS** there are usually two cameras available: `Front` and `Back` cameras. Depending on your use case you may either want to automatically select the `Front` camera or allow user to toggle between the `Front` and the `Back` cameras.
- You should handle the case where user does not have a camera device at all and the `WebCamTexture.devices` array is empty.
- For mobile platforms like **Android** or **iOS** it's best to request a permission to access the camera and handle the case where user did not grant the permission to use it. Read more in [Unity's docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.RequestUserAuthorization.html)

:::note

For Android, if you're setting the **WebCamTexture** resolution, you need to set the resolution as a multiple of 16x16 as required by webRTC
