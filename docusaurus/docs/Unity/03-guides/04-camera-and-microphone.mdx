This page details how to interact with **Microphone** and **Camera** devices to transmit audio and video streams to other call participants. Handling camera and microphone inputs in Unity can be challenging; however, Stream's Video SDK for Unity simplifies the process by managing the complexities internally, facilitating easy interaction with these devices.

## Interacting with Microphone

All interactions with microphone devices are handled by the `AudioDeviceManager` that can be accessed via `_client.AudioDeviceManager`. The `_client` field is an instance of `IStreamVideoClient`; if you haven't setup the video chat client yet, you can follow the [Client & Auth](../03-guides/01-client-auth.mdx) guide to learn how to do it.

#### List available microphone devices

All available microphone devices can be accessed with `AudioDeviceManager.EnumerateDevices()`. This method returns the `IEnumerable<MicrophoneDeviceInfo>`.
The `MicrophoneDeviceInfo` is a struct representing a single device. You can access the name of the device by the `Name` property.

```csharp
var microphones = _client.AudioDeviceManager.EnumerateDevices();

foreach (var mic in microphones)
{
    Debug.Log(mic.Name); // Get microphone name
}
```

#### Select microphone

**Declaration**
`public void SelectDevice(MicrophoneDeviceInfo device, bool enable)`

| --- | --- |
| `device` | Microphone to select |
| `enable` | Enabled device is capturing audio input |

```csharp
_client.AudioDeviceManager.SelectDevice(microphone, enable: true);
```

#### Get selected microphone

You get the currently selected microphone device via `AudioDeviceManager.SelectedDevice`. Please note, that the returned `MicrophoneDeviceInfo` is a struct meaning

```csharp
var selectedMicrophone = _client.AudioDeviceManager.SelectedDevice;
```

#### Start/Stop audio capturing

Once a device is selected, you can start/stop the audio capturing with the `Enable()`, `Disable()`, or `SetEnabled(bool isEnabled)` methods.

```csharp
// Enable device to start capturing microphone input
_client.AudioDeviceManager.Enable();

// Disable device to stop capturing microphone input
_client.AudioDeviceManager.Disable();

// Set the enabled state by passing a boolean argument
_client.AudioDeviceManager.SetEnabled(true);
```

#### Check if microphone is enabled

Enabled device is actively capturing audio input from a selected microphone.

```csharp
var isDeviceEnabled = _client.AudioDeviceManager.IsEnabled;
```

#### Events

The `SelectedDeviceChanged` and `IsEnabledChanged` events are triggered when a new device is selected or a device enabled state changes respectively.

```csharp
public void AudioDeviceManagerEvents()
{
    // Triggered when the selected devices changes
    _client.AudioDeviceManager.SelectedDeviceChanged += OnSelectedDeviceChanged;

    // Triggered when the IsEnabled property changes
    _client.AudioDeviceManager.IsEnabledChanged += OnIsEnabledChanged;
}

private void OnIsEnabledChanged(bool isEnabled) { }

private void OnSelectedDeviceChanged(MicrophoneDeviceInfo previousDevice, MicrophoneDeviceInfo currentDevice) { }
```

### Android & iOS

Users must grant permission to use the Microphone device for platforms like Android and IOS. Otherwise, capturing audio will not work. Typical patterns are requesting permissions when the application starts or when a user attempts to enable audio capturing.

#### iOS and WebGL

You can request permission to use a microphone device on iOS and WebGL platforms by using Unity's [RequestUserAuthorization](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.RequestUserAuthorization.html):

```csharp
// Request permission to use the Microphone
Application.RequestUserAuthorization(UserAuthorization.Microphone);

// Check if user granted microphone permission
if (!Application.HasUserAuthorization(UserAuthorization.Microphone))
{
    // Notify user that microphone permission was not granted and the microphone capturing will not work.
}
```

#### Android

For the Android platform, Unity recommends using the [Permission.RequestUserPermission](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Android.Permission.RequestUserPermission.html):

```csharp
// Request microphone permissions
Permission.RequestUserPermission(Permission.Microphone);

// Check if user granted microphone permission
if (!Permission.HasUserAuthorizedPermission(Permission.Microphone))
{
    // Notify user that microphone permission was not granted and the microphone capturing will not work.
}
```

## Interacting with Web Camera

All interactions with camera devices are handled by the `VideoDeviceManager` that can be accessed via `_client.VideoDeviceManager`. The `_client` field is an instance of `IStreamVideoClient`; if you haven't setup the video chat client yet, you can follow the [Client & Auth](../03-guides/01-client-auth.mdx) guide to learn how to do it.


#### List available camera devices

All available microphone devices can be accessed with `AudioDeviceManager.EnumerateDevices()`. This method returns the `IEnumerable<MicrophoneDeviceInfo>`.
The `MicrophoneDeviceInfo` is a struct representing a single device. You can access the name of the device by the `Name` property.

```csharp
var cameras = _client.VideoDeviceManager.EnumerateDevices();

foreach (var camera in cameras)
{
Debug.Log(camera.Name); // Get camera name
}
```

#### Select camera

**Declaration**
`public void SelectDevice(CameraDeviceInfo device, bool enable, int fps = 30)`

| --- | --- |
| `device` | Camera to select |
| `enable` | Enabled device is capturing video input |
| `fps` | (OPTIONAL) How many frames per second should the video be captured. The default value is `30` |

```csharp
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, enable: true, requestedFPS: 24);
```

**Declaration**
`public void SelectDevice(CameraDeviceInfo device, VideoResolution requestedResolution, bool enable, int requestedFPS = 30)`

| --- | --- |
| `device` | Camera to select |
| `enable` | Enabled device is capturing video input |
| `requestedResolution` | At what resolution should the video be captured |
| `fps` | (OPTIONAL) How many frames per second should the video be captured. The default value is `30` |

```csharp
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_720p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_720p, enable: true, requestedFPS: 30);
```

The `VideoResolution` argument type contains multiple predefined resolutions:
| Value | Resolution |
| `VideoResolution.Res_144p` | 256x144 |
| `VideoResolution.Res_240p` | 320x240 |
| `VideoResolution.Res_360p` | 480x360 |
| `VideoResolution.Res_480p` | 640x480 |
| `VideoResolution.Res_720p` | 1280x720 |
| `VideoResolution.Res_1080p` | 1920x1080 |
| `new VideoResolution(int width, int height` | custom resolution |

```csharp
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_144p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_240p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_360p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_480p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_720p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, VideoResolution.Res_1080p, enable: true);
_client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectDevice(camera, new VideoResolution(500, 500), enable: true);
```

#### Requested resolution and FPS

Please note that the video resolution and the FPS are the requested values passed to the camera device. Each device has it's own limitations and in case the passed values are not supported by the device the closest possible value will be selected.

#### Get Selected Camera

You can retrieve the currently selected camera device using `VideoDeviceManager.SelectedDevice`:

```csharp
public void GetSelectedCamera()
{
    var selectedCamera = _client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectedDevice;
}
```

#### Start/Stop Camera Capturing

Once a camera device is selected, you can start or stop the video capturing using the `Enable()`, `Disable()`, or `SetEnabled(bool isEnabled)` methods.

```csharp
public void StartStopCamera()
{
    // Enable device to start capturing camera input
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.Enable();

    // Disable device to stop capturing camera input
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.Disable();

    // Set the enabled state by passing a boolean argument
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.SetEnabled(true);
}
```

#### Check if Camera is Enabled

Check if the camera is enabled and actively capturing video input:

```csharp
public void CheckCameraStatus()
{
    // Check if currently selected device is enabled
    var isDeviceEnabled = _client.VideoDeviceManager.IsEnabled;
}
```

#### Get Local Participant Camera Preview

For the local participant there will be no video and audio track defined in the `IStreamVideoCallParticipant` object because those streams are not being received from the remote servers like for all remote participants. If you'd wish to present the local participant video stream you get a reference to the instance of `WebCamTexture` associated with the selected device via `_client.VideoDeviceManager.GetSelectedDeviceWebCamTexture()`.

```csharp
var webCamTexture = _client.VideoDeviceManager.GetSelectedDeviceWebCamTexture();

// You can attach this texture to RawImage UI Component
GetComponent<RawImage>().texture = webCamTexture;
```

Please note that the instance of `WebCamTexture` may change every time a new device is selected therefore you should subscribe to the `SelectedDeviceChanged` event:
```csharp
public void GetLocalParticipantVideoPreviewFull()
{
    // Triggered when the selected devices changes
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectedDeviceChanged += UpdateLocalParticipantPreview;
}

private void UpdateLocalParticipantPreview(CameraDeviceInfo previousDevice, CameraDeviceInfo currentDevice)
{
    var webCamTexture = _client.VideoDeviceManager.GetSelectedDeviceWebCamTexture();

    // You can attach this texture to RawImage UI Component
    GetComponent<RawImage>().texture = webCamTexture;
}
```

#### Check if camera is enabled

```csharp
public void CheckCameraStatus()
{
    // Check if currently selected device is enabled
    var isDeviceEnabled = _client.VideoDeviceManager.IsEnabled;
}
```

#### Events

`SelectedDeviceChanged` and `IsEnabledChanged` events occur when a new device is selected or the device's enabled state changes.

```csharp
public void VideoDeviceManagerEvents()
{
    // Triggered when the selected devices changes
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.SelectedDeviceChanged += OnSelectedDeviceChanged;

    // Triggered when the IsEnabled property changes
    _client.VideoDeviceManager.IsEnabledChanged += OnIsEnabledChanged;
}

private void OnIsEnabledChanged(bool isEnabled) { }

private void OnSelectedDeviceChanged(CameraDeviceInfo previousDevice, CameraDeviceInfo currentDevice) { }
```

### Android & iOS

Users must grant permission to use the Camera device on Android and iOS platforms. Permissions are typically requested when the application starts or when a user attempts to enable video capturing.

#### iOS and WebGL

For iOS and WebGL platforms, you can request camera permission using Unity's `RequestUserAuthorization`:

```csharp
public void CameraIOSPermissions()
{
    // Request permission to use the Camera
    Application.RequestUserAuthorization(UserAuthorization.WebCam);

    // Check if user granted camera permission
    if (!Application.HasUserAuthorization(UserAuthorization.WebCam))
    {
        // Notify user that camera permission was not granted and the camera capturing will not work.
    }
}
```

#### Android

On Android, request camera permissions using `Permission.RequestUserPermission`:

```csharp
public void CameraAndroidPermissions()
{
    // Request camera permissions
    Permission.RequestUserPermission(Permission.Camera);

    // Check if user granted camera permission
    if (!Permission.HasUserAuthorizedPermission(Permission.Camera))
    {
        // Notify user that camera permission was not granted and the camera capturing will not work.
    }
}
```
