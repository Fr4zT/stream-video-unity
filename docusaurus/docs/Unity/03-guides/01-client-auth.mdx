description: How to setup the client and authenticate
---

Before joining a call, it is necessary to set up the video client. Here's a basic example:

1. Create the `IStreamVideoClient` instance
    ```csharp
    _client = StreamVideoClient.CreateDefaultClient();
    ```
2. Connect user to the Stream API
    ```csharp
    var authCredentials = new AuthCredentials("api-key", "user-id", "user-token");
    await _client.ConnectUserAsync(authCredentials);
    ```

* The **API Key** can be found in your Stream dashboard.
* The **User** can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
* Note: You can store custom data on the user object, if required.

Here's a complete example of a MonoBehaviour that initiates the client and connects to the Stream API:
```csharp
using System;
using StreamVideo.Core;
using StreamVideo.Libs.Auth;
using UnityEngine;

public class VideoClient : MonoBehaviour
{
    async void Start()
    {
        _client = StreamVideoClient.CreateDefaultClient();

        try
        {
            var authCredentials = new AuthCredentials("api-key", "user-id", "user-token");
            await _client.ConnectUserAsync(authCredentials);
            
            // After we awaited the ConnectUserAsync the client is connected
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Debug.LogError(e.Message);
        }
    }

    private IStreamVideoClient _client;
}
```

### Generating a token

* Tokens need to be generated server side. You can use our server side SDKs to quickly add support for this.
Typically you integrate this into the part of your codebase where you login or register users.
The tokens provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.

* Here's a valid user and token to help you get started on the client side, before integrating with your backend API.

### Client options

Here's a more complete example of the client options:

```csharp
var config = new StreamClientConfig
{
    // Enabling Debug level logging can be helpful during development
    LogLevel = StreamLogLevel.Debug,
    Audio =
    {
        // Increase audio quality in exchange for higher bandwidth 
        EnableRed = false,
        
        // DTX encodes silence at lower bitrate. This can save bandwidth
        EnableDtx = false
    }
};
_client = StreamVideoClient.CreateDefaultClient(config);
```

You can pass additional configuration options through the `StreamClientConfig` instance passed to the `CreateDefaultClient` method.
