title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed

### Stateful models

Stream's Video SDK for Unity contains several **stateful** models that automatically receive events from the Stream Server and update their inner state. Thanks to this you can always rely on them having the most up-to-date state.

Stateful models:
* **IStreamCall** - represents a call object
* **IStreamVideoUser** - represents a user
* **IStreamVideoCallParticipant** - represents a user that is participating in a call. Note that a single user could join from several devices and show up as multiple participants

### Call State

Here's an example of how you can access the call state:

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Get call or create if it doesn't exist
var streamCall = await _client.GetOrCreateCallAsync(callType, callId);
```

Here's an outline of the `IStreamCall` object:

### Events

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ParticipantJoined` | Fired when a new participant joins the call |
| `ParticipantLeft` | Fired when a participant leaves the call |
| `ParticipantTrackAdded` | Fired when a track is added for a participant in the call |
| `DominantSpeakerChanged` | Fired when the most actively speaking participant in the call changes |
| `ReactionAdded` | Fired when a call participant adds a reaction to the call |
| `PinnedParticipantsUpdated` | Fired when the `PinnedParticipants` collection is updated |
| `RecordingStarted` | Fired when recording of the call starts |
| `RecordingStopped` | Fired when recording of the call stops |
| `SortedParticipantsUpdated` | Fired when the `SortedParticipants` collection is updated |

### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Participants` | Users that are currently in the call. The complete list of users associated with the call can be obtained via `Members`. |
| `DominantSpeaker` | The participant that is currently the most actively speaking. Changes in the dominant speaker trigger the `DominantSpeakerChanged` event. The `PreviousDominantSpeaker` can also be obtained. |
| `PreviousDominantSpeaker` | The participant who was the last dominant speaker before the current one. |
| `PinnedParticipants` | Participants that are pinned to this call, sorted by the time they were pinned. Locally pinned participants are listed first, followed by those pinned remotely. Updates to this collection trigger the `PinnedParticipantsUpdated` event. |
| `SortedParticipants` | Participants sorted by pin status, screen-sharing status, dominant speaker, video participants, and audio-only participants. Any update to this collection triggers the `SortedParticipantsUpdated` event. |
| `OwnCapabilities` | A list of actions the user has permission to perform in the call. |
| `Id` | The identifier of the call. |
| `Cid` | The unique identifier for the call, combining `Type` and `Id`. |
| `Type` | The type of call, which determines the permissions schema used. Types can be predefined or custom-created via the dashboard. |
| `IsLocalUserOwner` | Indicates whether the local user is the owner of the call. |
| `Members` | Users permanently associated with the call, including those who haven't joined. This includes all invited participants, regardless of whether they have joined the call. |
| `Recording` | Indicates whether the call is currently being recorded. |
| `BlockedUsers` | A list of users that are blocked in this call. |
| `Settings` | The settings configured for this call. |
| `Backstage` | Indicates whether the call is in backstage mode. |
| `CreatedAt` | The date and time when the call was created. |
| `UpdatedAt` | The date and time of the last update to the call. |
| `StartsAt` | The scheduled start time of the call. |
| `EndedAt` | The date and time when the call ended. |
| `Team` | The team that the call is restricted to. |
| `CreatedBy` | The user who created the call. |
| `Ingress` | Indicates if there is an active ingress session to this call (e.g., sending RTMP into the call). |

### Methods

| `BlockUserAsync` | Block a user from the call |
| `UnblockUserAsync` | Unblock a user from the call |
| `HasPermissions` | Check if you currently have a certain permission |
| `RequestPermissionAsync` | Request a permission from the call host |
| `RequestPermissionsAsync` | Request multiple permissions from the call host |
| `GrantPermissionsAsync` | Grant permissions to a user in this call |
| `RevokePermissionsAsync` | Revoke permissions from a user in this call |
| `AcceptAsync` | Mark an incoming call as accepted |
| `RejectAsync` | Mark an incoming call as rejected |
| `StartHLS` | Start HTTP Live Streaming |

| `MuteUsersAsync` | Mute specific users in the call |
| `QueryMembersAsync` | Query members in the call |
| `SendReactionAsync` | Send a reaction in the call |
| `SendCustomEventAsync` | Send a custom event in the call |
| `PinLocally` | Pin a participant locally |
| `UnpinLocally` | Unpin a participant locally |
| `IsPinnedLocally` | Check if a participant is pinned locally |
| `IsPinnedRemotely` | Check if a participant is pinned remotely |
| `IsPinned` | Check if a participant is pinned |


### Participant State

The **Call Participant State** represented by a `IStreamVideoCallParticipant` object is the most essential component used to render a participant in a call. It contains all of the information to render a participant, such as audio & video renderers, availabilities of audio & video, the screen sharing session, reactions, and etc. Here's how you iterate over the participants:

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Notice that we pass create argument as true - this will create the call if it doesn't already exist
var streamCall = await _client.JoinCallAsync(callType, callId, create: true, ring: false, notify: false);

foreach (var participant in streamCall.Participants)
{
    // Handle call participant. For example: spawn a prefab that will contain RawImage to show the video and an AudioSource to play the audio

    // Iterate over participant tracks. They can be either of type `StreamVideoTrack` or `StreamAudioTrack`
    foreach (var track in participant.GetTracks())
    {
        
    }
    
    // Subscribe to `TrackAdded` event in order to get notified about new tracks added later
    participant.TrackAdded += OnParticipantTrackAdded;
}

// Subscribe to `ParticipantJoined` and `ParticipantLeft` to get notified when a new participant joins the call or a participant left the call
streamCall.ParticipantJoined += OnParticipantJoined; 
streamCall.ParticipantLeft += OnParticipantLeft; 
```

Here's an outline of the `IStreamVideoCallParticipant` object:

### Events

| `TrackAdded` | Fired when a track is added for this participant. Tracks represent streams of video and audio. |

### Properties

| --- | --- |
| `IsPinned` | Indicates if this participant is "pinned" in the call, giving them precedence in the `IStreamCall.SortedParticipants` list |
| `IsScreenSharing` | Indicates if this participant is currently streaming a screen share track |
| `IsVideoEnabled` | Indicates if this participant is currently streaming a video track |
| `IsAudioEnabled` | Indicates if this participant is currently streaming an audio track |
| `IsDominantSpeaker` | Indicates if this participant is currently the most actively speaking participant |
| `UserId` | The user ID of the participant |
| `SessionId` | A unique identifier for a participant in a call, allowing for multiple instances of the same user through different devices |
| `TrackLookupPrefix` | A prefix used for track lookup |
| `Name` | The name of the participant |
| `IsLocalParticipant` | Indicates if this is the participant from the local device |
| `User` | The `IStreamVideoUser` associated with the participant |
