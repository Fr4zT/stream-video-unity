title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed

### Stateful models

Stream's Video SDK for Unity contains several **stateful** models that automatically receive events from the Stream Server and update its inner state. Thanks to this you can always rely on them having the most up-to-date state.

Stateful models:
* **IStreamCall** - represents a call object
* **IStreamVideoUser** - represents a user
* **IStreamVideoCallParticipant** - represents a user that is participating in a call. Note that a single user could join from several devices and show up as multiple participants

### Call State

Here's an example of how you can access the call state:

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Get call or create if it doesn't exist
var streamCall = await _client.GetOrCreateCallAsync(callType, callId);
```

The following fields are available on the call

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |

| `Participants` | The list of call participants |
| `Members` | The list of call members |
| `Recording` | Boolean if the call is being recorded or not |
| `BlockedUsers` | The users who are blocked from this call |
| `Settings` | The settings for this call |
| `OwnCapabilities` | Which actions you have permission to do |
| `Backstage` | If a call is in backstage mode or not |
| `CreatedAt` | When the call was created |
| `UpdatedAt` | When the call was updated |
| `StartsAt` | When the call is scheduled to start |
| `EndedAt` | When the call ended |
| `Team` | Team that the call is restricted to. Default to null. |
| `CreatedBy` | Who created the call |
| `Ingress` | If there is an active ingress session to this call. IE if you're sending RTMP into the call |

The following methods are available on the call

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |

| `HasPermissions` | method for checking if you have a certain permission |


### Participant State

The **Call Participant State** represented by a `IStreamVideoCallParticipant` object is the most essential component used to render a participant in a call. It contains all of the information to render a participant, such as audio & video renderers, availabilities of audio & video, the screen sharing session, reactions, and etc. Here's how you iterate over the participants:

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Notice that we pass create argument as true - this will create the call if it doesn't already exist
var streamCall = await _client.JoinCallAsync(callType, callId, create: true, ring: false, notify: false);

foreach (var participant in streamCall.Participants)
{
    // Handle call participant. For example: spawn a prefab that will contain RawImage to show the video and an AudioSource to play the audio

    // Iterate over participant tracks. They can be either of type `StreamVideoTrack` or `StreamAudioTrack`
    foreach (var track in participant.GetTracks())
    {
        
    }
    
    // Subscribe to `TrackAdded` event in order to get notified about new tracks added later
    participant.TrackAdded += OnParticipantTrackAdded;
}

// Subscribe to `ParticipantJoined` and `ParticipantLeft` to get notified when a new participant joins the call or a participant left the call
streamCall.ParticipantJoined += OnParticipantJoined; 
streamCall.ParticipantLeft += OnParticipantLeft; 
```

The following fields are available on the participant

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `User` | The user object for this participant |
| `VideoTrack` | The video track object for this participant |
| `AudioTrack` | The participant's audio track object |
| `ScreenShareTrack` | The screensharing track object |
| `JoinedAt` | When this participant joined |
| `AudioLevel` | How loudly this user is talking. Float |
| `IsSpeaking` | If the user is speaking |
| `ConnectionQuality` | The participant's connection quality |
| `IsDominantSpeaker` | If this participant is the dominant speaker or not |
