For many video calling, livestream or audio rooms apps you'll want to show:

* Upcoming calls
* Calls that are currently live
* Popular livestreams/audio rooms with a link to the recording

The SDK makes it easy to query calls

### Example Queries

**Calls that are about to start**

```csharp
// Filter calls that will start in 3 hours and include me
var filters = new List<IFieldFilterRule>
{
    CallFilter.StartsAt.LessThanOrEquals(DateTime.Now.AddHours(3)),
    CallFilter.Members.EqualsTo(_client.LocalUser)
};

// Order them by how soon they start
var result = await _client.QueryCallsAsync(filters, CallSort.OrderByAscending(CallSortField.StartsAt), limit: 25);
```

**Calls filters on a custom property**

```csharp
// Filter calls by custom property. For example you can attach a "tag" property to a call and get calls that contain any of the provided tags 
var filters = new List<IFieldFilterRule>
{
    CallFilter.Custom("tag").In("xbox", "ps", "switch"),
};

// Order them by how soon they start
var sort = CallSort.OrderByAscending(CallSortField.StartsAt);

var result = await _client.QueryCallsAsync(filters, sort, limit: 25);
```

**Pagination**
The query response is paginated and the maximum count of items is defined by the `limit` parameter.
Use the `prev` and `next` parameters from the last response as parameters for requesting the next page.

```csharp
var filters = new List<IFieldFilterRule>
{
    CallFilter.CreatedAt.GreaterThan(DateTime.Now.AddHours(-24))
};

var result = await _client.QueryCallsAsync(filters, CallSort.OrderByDescending(CallSortField.CreatedAt), limit: 25);

// queried calls, depending on how many calls satisfy the filter this can be only a subset or a single "page" of results
var members = result.Calls;

// In order to get the next "page" of results, use this token as a "next" argument in the QueryCallsAsync method
var next = result.Next;

// In order to get the previous "page" of results, use this token as a "prev" argument in the QueryCallsAsync method
var prev = result.Prev;
```

### Fields for Query Calls

You can filter on the following fields

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The call type. Typically default, livestream etc |
| `id` | The id for this call |
| `cid` | The cid for this call. IE default:123 |
| `created_by_user_id` | The user id who created the call |
| `created_at` | When the call was created |
| `updated_at` | When the call was updated |
| `starts_at` | When the call starts at |
| `ended_at` | When the call ended |
| `backstage` | If the call is in backstage mode or not |
| `members` | Check if you are a member of this call |
| `custom` | You can query custom data using the "custom.myfield" syntax |

Sorting is supported on these fields below:

* `starts_at`
* `created_at`
* `updated_at`
* `ended_at`
* `type`
* `id`
* `cid`

If you specify `watch` the SDK will automatically keep the data about these calls updated.
This allows you to show a live preview of who's in the call.
