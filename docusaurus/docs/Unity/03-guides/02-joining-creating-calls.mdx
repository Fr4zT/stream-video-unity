title: Joining & Creating Calls
description: An overview of how to create calls and join them
---

### Joining a call

Most commonly, you will want to either join another call or create a new call and join it immediately.

You can easily achieve this with the `_client.JoinCallAsync` method and setting the `create` argument to **true** if you're creating a new call or **false** if you're joining another call.

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Notice that we pass create argument as true - this will create the call if it doesn't already exist
var streamCall = await _client.JoinCallAsync(callType, callId, create: true, ring: true, notify: false);
```

The **call type** controls which features are enabled, and sets up permissions. You can read more about the **call types** [here](../03-guides/05-call-types.mdx)

For the call id there are a few things to note:

* You can reuse the same call multiple times.
* If you have a unique id for the call we recommend passing that as the id.

### Creating a call

If you wish to only create a call object, that you'll join later, you can use the `_client.GetOrCreateCallAsync` method.

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Get call or create if it doesn't exist
var streamCall = await _client.GetOrCreateCallAsync(callType, callId);
```

### Get a call

To get a call by **id** and the **call type** you can use the `_client.GetCallAsync` method. This method will return the call object if it exists or return null if the call was not found.

```csharp
var callType = StreamCallType.Default; // Call type affects default permissions
var callId = "my-call-id";

// Try to get call - will return null if the call doesn't exist
var streamCall = await _client.GetCallAsync(callType, callId);
```

### Querying Members

You can query the members of the call. This is helpful if you have thousands of members in a call and want to paginate.

```csharp
var filters = new List<IFieldFilterRule>
{
    CallMemberFilter.Role.EqualsTo("admin")
};
var result = await streamCall.QueryMembersAsync(filters, CallMemberSort.OrderByDescending(CallMemberSortField.LastActive), limit: 25);

// queried members, depending on how many members satisfy the filter this can be only a subset or a single "page" of results
var members = result.Members;

// In order to get the next "page" of results, use this token as a "next" argument in the QueryMembersAsync method
var next = result.Next;

// In order to get the previous "page" of results, use this token as a "prev" argument in the QueryMembersAsync method
var prev = result.Prev;
```

You can **filter** the member list on these fields, and sort on the selected fields.
Note that you can also query on custom data for the member or the user.

| Option | Description | Sorting Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | The user's id | Yes |
| `role` | The member's role | No |
| `custom` | The custom data on the member | No |
| `created_at` | When the member was created | Yes |
| `updated_at` | When the member was last updated | No |
