Stream Video SDK is built on top of [Unity's WebRTC library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/index.html) and therefore follows the same requirements.

Please refer to [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/requirements.html) page for additional information on building for Android and IOS. 

If you feel like anything is missing or could be improved, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://getstream.io/contact/). We're happy to help.
