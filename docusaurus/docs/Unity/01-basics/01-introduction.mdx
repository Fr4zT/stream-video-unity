Stream Video SDK is built on top of [Unity's WebRTC library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/index.html) and therefore follows the same requirements.

How to start?
* Please follow the [Installation Guide](./basics/installation/) first
* After that you can either proceed with the [Core Concepts Guides](./guides/client-auth/) or the [Quickstart Guide](./basics/quickstart/) if you just wish to skim through all the essential integration steps
* If you're interested in building for **Android** or **IOS** platforms, be sure to check out the [Platforms Guides](./platforms/overview/) for additional information

If you feel like anything is missing or could be improved, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://getstream.io/contact/). We're happy to help.
