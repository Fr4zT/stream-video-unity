description: Building for IOS platform
---

#### Prerequisites
- Install IOS Module in Unity HUB (if needed)
- Switch the project to IOS platform (File -> Build Settings -> Platform)

#### Requirement for IOS Build
- disable the **bitcode** option in **Xcode project** exported from Unity. On the Xcode **Build Settings** tab, in the **Build Options** group, set **Enable Bitcode** to **No**.

Stream's Video SDK uses Unity's webRTC library internally and therefore follows the same requirements and limitations. For more information please refer to Unity's [webRTC package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/requirements.html).
