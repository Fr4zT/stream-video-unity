This page describes additional steps required when building for the **Android** platform.

#### Prerequisites
- Install Android Module in Unity HUB
- Change the target platform to **Android** in Unity Editor (File -> Build Settings -> Platform)

You can check [Unity Docs](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/publishing-for-android) for detailed information on setting up the project for Android development. Please note that setting up the **Keystore Manager** is only required when you intend to publish the app; you can skip this step when testing the app on your local device only.

#### Build Settings requirements
Go to "File -> Build Settings -> Player Settings"
- Set Scripting Backend to **IL2CPP** (Other Settings -> Scripting Backend)
- Set Target Architectures to **ARM64** and disable **ARMv7** (Other Settings -> Target Architectures)
- Set **Require** for the **Internet Access** option
- Set the **Android API Level** to **23 or higher** (Other Settings -> Identification -> Minimum API Level)

Stream's **Video & Audio SDK** internally uses Unity's webRTC library, following the exact requirements and limitations. For more information, please refer to Unity's [webRTC package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/requirements.html).
